## Documentation

### Formatting

R Markdown documents are created using the R packages **rmarkdown** and **knitr**.
These packages are used to create a variety of different documents including html, pdf, word, and powerpoint to name a few. 
General formatting is specified in the *YAML*. 

```
title: "Midterm Vignette"
author: "Wesley Newcomb"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output: 
  pdf_document:
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 3
```

In the example above, we can see that the *YAML* supplies formatting instructions that are read sequentially. 
For the output, we are specifying that we want to create a pdf document that contains a table of contents with a depth of three.
For a more thorough explanation of R Markdown's features, I recommend the following: [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)

If you would like to explore more custom control of document formatting without adapting to a completely different system, I recommend the following: [bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)

### Code chunks

Code that is to be executed (rather than just displayed as formatted text) is called a **code chunk**.
To specify a code chunk, you need to include **{r}** immediately after the backticks that start the code block (the **```**).
```
{r options_example, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
```

In the example above, we name the code chunk **options_example**.
After naming the code chunk (if you don't name the code chunk R Markdown will name it randomly for you!), specify chunk options after the first comma. 
Here we use `echo` and `message` which tells R Markdown not to show source code and not to show warning messages output from R code. 
For a complete list of **knitr** code chunk options, please see the following: [Chunk options and package options](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/).

## Vectors

Vectors are the fundamental data type in R.
That is, everything is a vector!
Vectors are a collections  of elements that are all the same type (logical, numeric, and character).
Create vectors using the `c()` function. 

```{r}
vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
print(vector)
```

We can create vectors using other ways as well.

```{r}
vector <- 1:10 # Colon operator generate sequences
print(vector)

vector <- seq(1, 10) # We can also use the seq() function
print(vector)

vector <- seq(1, 10, by = 0.5) # We can control the increment when generating sequences
print(vector)

vector <- rep(NA, times = 10) # rep() is good for creating a vector of repeated values (convenient for initializing a variable before a loop)
print(vector)
```

We can determine the length of a vector using the `length()` function.

```{r}
length(vector)
```

Subsetting vectors is easy using `[]` and `[[]]`.

```{r}
vector <- 1:10

vector[1]
vector[[1]]
vector[3]
vector[[3]]
```

When we remember that everything is a vector (even if it only has a length of 1) we have tremendous power in our ability to subset. 
We can subset vectors with vectors in many ways. 

```{r}
## Lets try subsetting using an index vector
desired_indices <- c(1, 3, 8)
letters[desired_indices]

## The order of the index vector matters!
letters[c(1, 3, 8)]
letters[c(8, 1, 3)]

## We can use function outputs as index vectors too
letters[3:14]
letters[seq(3, 14)]
letters[seq(1, length(letters), 2)] # We can use this principle to subset every other element in a vector

## We can also use logical vectors to subset 
less_than_five <- vector < 5 
print(less_than_five)
class(less_than_five)

vector[less_than_five] # When we subset with a logical vector we return elements that are TRUE
vector[vector < 5] # We can do this without declaring a new variable too!
```

It is important to note that `[]` and `[[]]` handle index vectors differently in that `[]` can handle index vectors with more than one element and `[[]]` can only handle index vectors with one element. 

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
letters[1:10] # OK
letters[[1:10]] # ERROR
```

We can use these principles to modify vectors.

```{r}
### We can modify specific elements of vector
## Using index vector
# Using seq() function
vector[seq(1, length(vector), 2)] <- vector[seq(1, length(vector), 2)] * 2 # Multiples every other element by two
print(vector)

# Using length() to add a new element
vector[length(vector) + 1] <- "New Element"
print(vector)

## Using logical vector
vector[vector < 5] <- "Small Number"
print(vector) # print() will coerce all elements to most flexible data type used (i.e. character)
```

## Lists

Lists are very similar to vectors but are different in various ways. 
1. Lists can store more than one type of data
  - Lists can store numerics, logicals, characters, vectors, and even other lists.
  
```{r}
list_example <- list(alphabet = letters,
                     capitals = LETTERS,
                     f = letters == "f",
                     element = seq(1, length(letters)))
print(list_example)
```

2. Lists have element tags for unique accession

```{r}
# Use $ to access element of list and returns vectors
list_example$alphabet
list_example$element

print(paste0(list_example$element, ": ", list_example$alphabet))

# We can nest $ for nested lists
new_list <- list(hundred = 1:100)
new_list$hundred
list_example$new <- new_list # Adds a new element to list_example that is also a list
list_example$new$hundred # Uses two $ to access an element in a list in a list
```

Lists are also able to be subsetted using `[]` and `[[]]`.
When we use `[]` with lists, however, it will return a list (whereas with a vector it will return a vector).
When we use `[[]]` it will return whatever data type is stored in that element of the list.
This can be a character, a numeric, or logical vector, or even another list.

```{r}
list_example[1]
class(list_example[1])

list_example[[1]]
class(list_example[[1]])

list_example[5]
class(list_example[5])

list_example[[5]]
class(list_example[[5]])
```

The `[]` function has unique functionality with lists as opposed to vectors in that you can also specify the name of the list element as a string.

```{r}
list_example["capitals"]
list_example[c("capitals", "alphabet")]
```

## Controlling flow

Control statements allow us to compute things based on their value. 
The most common test to do this is `if`, `else`, and `else if`. 
`if` and `else` statements can be thought of by saying "if _____ is true then do this, else do this if it is false" where _____ is a conditional statement (like `x == 1`, `x > 1`, `x >= 1`, `x < 1`, `x <= 1`, `x != 1`, `is.numeric(x)`, etc).
`if else` statements are used to control flow for new conditions.

```{r}
if (is.list(list_example)) cat("This is a list!\n")

if (is.numeric(list_example)) {
  cat("This is a numeric vector!\n")
  } else if (is.character(list_example)) {
  cat("This is a character vector!\n")
  } else {
  cat("This is not a numeric or character vector!\n")
}
```

Sometimes we want to be able to automate through a vector, list, or data frame to perform computations on each element in that object.
R makes it easy for us with vectors and lists. 
Vectorized functions are both fast and intuitive. 
The `apply` family of functions for vectors, lists, data frames and many more is also fast and intuitive. 
Despite having these options, R also provides us with the ability to iterate (moving through elements in a data object) using `for` and `while` loops. 
These loops may function more slowly but sometimes they are necessary (though you should reconsider your analysis before deciding to use them).

## Functions

Functions are useful for doing something the same way repeatably.

## Data frames

Data frames are the predominate data form used in data science. 
Data frames share alot of functionality with lists and can be manipulated in a similar manner. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```


```{r}
# Load starwars data set from dplyr package
data("starwars")
starwars # starwars prints like this because it is a tibble (tibbles will be discussed shortly but are handled nearly the same way as data frames)

# Starwars has 87 rows representing a different starwars character 
nrow(starwars)

# Starwars is a data set with 13 different columns
length(starwars)

## Lets subset starwars data set for human characters. How?

# Species is a character vector that returns TRUE at indices that meet the condition specified (species == "Human")
starwars$species == "Human"

# We use this logical vector to subset our data frame (just like vectors and lists!)
# The blank space after the comma tells R to return all columns to rows where species is human
starwars[starwars$species == "Human", ]

# What if we were only interested in the homeworlds and names for humans in starwars? 
starwars[starwars$species == "Human", c("name", "homeworld")]

# What if we wanted to find the max mass for people of different home worlds and make it a data frame?
homeworlds <- unique(starwars$homeworld)

max_mass <- rep(NA, length(homeworlds))
for (i in 1:length(homeworlds)) {
  max_mass[i] <- max(as.data.frame(starwars)[starwars$homeworld == homeworlds[i], "mass"], na.rm = TRUE)
}

homeworld_masses <- data.frame("Homeworld" = homeworlds,
                              "Max.Mass" = max_mass)

# We can use subsetting to order this table by decreasing mass (in this example we are limiting the results to the top ten)
#homeworld_masses <- homeworld_masses[order(homeworld_masses$Average.Mass, decreasing = TRUE)[1:10], ]

print(homeworld_masses, row.names = FALSE)

# We can turn this into a table using kable
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

kable(homeworld_masses, row.names = FALSE) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed", "hover"))
```
